# Alien-Invasion
The game Alien Invasion puts players in command of a rocket ship situated at the screen's bottom center. Using the arrow keys, players navigate the ship left and right while employing the spacebar to launch projectiles. At the game's onset, the sky fills with a menacing fleet of aliens that traverse horizontally and descend vertically across the screen. Players must strategically shoot and obliterate these aliens to progress. As the game advances, subsequent alien fleets increase in speed, intensifying the challenge. However, players must exercise caution as any contact between an alien and the player's ship or if an alien breaches the screen's bottom results in the loss of a ship. Losing three ships concludes the game.
